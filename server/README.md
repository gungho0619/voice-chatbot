## Installation

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gungho0619/voice-chatbot
```

Prepare environment variables by creating `.env` at the project root. You need to sign up for an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/overview).

```t
PORT=8000 # Or whichever port available
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"
```

Start the server and you are done! Remember to use Node 18 or higher, this is the requirement of this package's core dependency â€“ [`chatgpt`](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api).

```bash
npm install

# Run locally, or...
npm run dev

# Run on production
npm run build
npm run start
```
